# Intrusion Detection System using ANN

This project is a graphical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built with **Python**, **Tkinter GUI**, and an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using `scikit-learn`. It allows users to register/login, upload CSV datasets, train an ANN model, and predict cyber threats in a visually interactive way.

# Features

- User login and registration
- Load and preview CSV datasets
- Train Artificial Neural Network model
- Predict cyber threat categories based on inputs
- Visualize data with charts and heatmaps
- Dark-themed Tkinter GUI for better user experience

# How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download `project.py`.
2. Place it in a folder with your dataset (CSV format).
3. Run the app:
```bash
python project.py
```
4. Register a user or log in to start using the system.
5. Load your dataset, train the model, and make predictions.
